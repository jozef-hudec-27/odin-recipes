        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 baking potatoes</li>
            <li>1 avocado, halved and sliced</li>
            <li>½ a red onion, finely sliced</li>
            <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
            <li>1 TBSP of olive oil</li>
            <li>75g cheddar , grated</li>
            <li>2 TSP of fajita spice mix</li>
            <li>2 spring onions, finely sliced</li>
            <li>½ small pack coriander, leaves picked and stalks finely chopped</li>
            <li>soured cream, to serve</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat grill to high. Prick the potatoes with a fork and microwave on high for 5-10 mins until soft. Meanwhile,
                toss the avocado and red onion with the lime juice and half the oil. Once the potatoes have cooked, slice in
                half and scoop out the flesh into a bowl. Drizzle the skins with the remaining olive oil and grill for 5-10
                mins to crisp up.
            </li>

            <li>
                Mash the potato with the cheese, fajita spice mix, most of the spring onions and coriander stalks. Once the potato
                skins have crisped up, remove from the grill and spoon the filling into them. Top with the coriander leaves,
                remaining spring onions and the soured cream, and serve with the avocado and onion salad.
            </li>

            <li>Enjoy!</li>
